cout<<"#With the use of computer graphics we can control the animation by adjusting the speed, portion of picture in view the amount of detail shown and so on."<<endl;
cout<<"#It provides facility called update dynamics. With this we can change the shape color and other properties of object."<<endl;
cout<<"#Now in recent development of digital signal processing and audio synthesis chip the interactive graphics can now provide audio feedback along with the graphical feed backs."<<endl;
